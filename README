Summary

DrooPHP will be a PHP library to enable counting results for an STV election, based on the contents of a BLT (ballot) file.

An aim is to emulate Droop - the Python project. However, DrooPHP is unlikely to become as mature as Droop any time soon. See:
http://code.google.com/p/droop/

Main design differences between DrooPHP and Droop:
* DrooPHP needs new lines (LF or CRLF) to separate BLT file information, as is customary (but not required) in the BLT standard.
* DrooPHP does not support C-style comments /* like this */.
